# Decisions

> Team decisions that all agents must respect. Append-only — never edit existing entries.

### 2026-02-10: User directive
**By:** bradygaster (via Copilot)
**What:** This codebase is large — no single agent should try to scan it all at once. Document incrementally, piece by piece, until the whole codebase is documented.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-10: MVC Server Is a Scaffold — All Game Logic Lives in Legacy ASMX
**By:** Gus (Server Dev)
**Status:** Observation (not a change proposal)

**What:** The MVC server (`ServerMVC/TerrariumServer/`) contains only ASP.NET MVC 2 template code — Account management and a placeholder Home controller. Zero game-related endpoints exist. All ecosystem functionality — peer discovery, species registration, population reporting, crash logging, messaging — lives in the legacy `Server/Website/` as ASMX web services backed by direct ADO.NET calls to SQL Server stored procedures.

**Why:**
1. Client devs: clients talk to the legacy ASMX endpoints. Any API contract changes must account for the legacy service signatures (SOAP/DataSet-based).
2. Don't assume the MVC project has any game functionality. It doesn't.
3. Modernization means migrating 7+ ASMX services (with stored procedure dependencies) to MVC controllers or Web API. The `BugService` is a stub (`TODO` in code).
4. Database: Schema is `TerrariumWhidbey` in SQL Server. ~14 tables, ~17 stored procs. All data access is inline ADO.NET — no ORM.

### 2026-02-10: Build Must Be Green Before New Tests
**By:** Hank (Tester/QA)
**Status:** Proposed

**What:**
1. No new tests should be written against the current MSTest/MVC2 test project. The 15 existing tests are stock MVC template tests and test nothing Terrarium-specific.
2. The build infrastructure must be modernized first. Before any test strategy can execute, the team needs to decide: retarget to a buildable framework, or provide the .NET Framework 4.0 Developer Pack.
3. CI/CD must be established. There is zero build automation.
4. When a new test project is created, prefer xUnit over MSTest.

**Why:** Nothing builds, nothing runs, nothing is tested. Any code changes are flying blind until this is resolved.

### 2026-02-10: ClientWPF is empty scaffolding — Client/ is the source of truth (consolidated)
**By:** Heisenberg, Jesse, Mike
**Status:** Observation / Proposed

**What:** The `ClientWPF/` directory contains 13 projects, all of which are empty .NET 4.0 shells containing only `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` (and for TerrariumClient, empty `App.xaml`/`MainWindow.xaml`). No business logic has been ported. The WPF rewrite was abandoned before any meaningful code was migrated.

Any modernization work must use `Client/` as the source of truth:
- `Client/Renderer/`, `Client/Glass/`, `Client/Controls/` — full WinForms implementations
- `Client/TerrariumWPF/` and `Client/ControlsWPF/` — partial earlier WPF port with real XAML (closest starting point for WPF migration)
- `Client/Game/`, `Client/OrganismBase/`, `Client/HttpListener/`, `Client/Services/`, `Client/AsmCheck/`, `Client/Configuration/` — all real engine/networking/infrastructure code

Similarly for the server: `Server/Website/` is the functional server; `ServerMVC/TerrariumServer/` is boilerplate.

**Why:**
- Do not invest time fixing or extending `ClientWPF/` projects
- When modernizing, port code from `Client/` to new project structure
- The `Terrraium2010.sln` is useful for server work but misleading for client work
- The WPF stubs will need to either be populated (if migration proceeds) or removed
